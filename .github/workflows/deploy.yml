# This is a working example of using GitHub Actions to publish the docs
# to the GitHub Pages (gh_pages) branch.
#
# Remember to have a requirements.txt file with the required dependencies.
# This template ships with one by default.
#
# It is also recommendet to also copy the template with all branches, to
# have the gh-pages branch pre-made. This prevents possible errors.
